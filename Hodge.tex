\par We have constructed the spaces $V^s_{n,d}$ of stable vector bundles on a curve. In the second part, we turn our attention to the case $k = \C$ (in particular, our vector bundles are \textbf{complex} vector bundles). This choice is necessary, as it gives us access to methods from analysis and differential geometry. In this setting, it turns out $V^s_{n,d}$ has a nice characterisation, known as the \textit{Narasimhan-Seshadri Correspondence}, or the \textit{Narasimhan-Seshadri Theorem}, which will be stated in the next chapter. In this chapter, we will be concerned with the theory of complex manifolds, and in particular various topics such as Hodge theory and Sobolev theory will be discussed. 
\section{Hodge Theory}

The basic idea of Hodge theory is to find certain repre
